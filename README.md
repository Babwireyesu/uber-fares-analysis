 Uber Fares Data Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard analyzing Uber Fares data using Python and Power BI. The goal is to uncover insights into fare amounts, ride patterns, time-based trends, and geographic ride distribution.

 Project Structure

- `uber_cleaned_features.csv` — Cleaned and enhanced dataset used in Power BI
- `Uber_Fares_Analysis.pbix` — Power BI dashboard file
- `screenshots/` — Visuals showing steps and final dashboard
- `README.md` — Project overview (this file)

 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Geopy) — for data cleaning and feature engineering
- Power BI Desktop — for data visualization and dashboard creation

 Key Features of the Dashboard

- Fare distribution (histogram and box plot)
- Average fare by hour, weekday, and month
- Ride frequency trends over time
- Peak vs. off-peak ride patterns
- Geographic ride mapping using lat/lon
- Interactive filters (slicers) for deeper exploration

 Insights

- Most rides occur during peak commute hours.
- Average fares vary by time of day and day of the week.
